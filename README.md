## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Demo Setup Instructions

1.	Get started by making changes into the .env file, by making changes to the database details
2.	If you are setting it on a server, a database file is included within the server. If setting it up locally, you need to run the Laravel command ‘php artisan migrate’ for it.
3.	If working locally, you need to run the command in cmd for the Laravel server, that is ‘php artisan serve’. For this you need to redirect to the project folder through cmd.
4.	Then for React, you need to run ‘npm run watch’, so that all changes are tracked and updated accordingly.
5.	In this code, MySQL is used as a database, ReactJS for the front-end, and Laravel for back-end.
6.	The Index file is placed in resources/js/components/Index.js
